# what-i-learned-in-week-5
It's *only* been 6 weeks!
___
This week we learned how to select specific characters from a '

Booleans: Continued work on booleans. We completed exercises on returning a string commenting on the size of a string and created an Node run 'app'/FizzBuzz exercise to continue 'if, if else, else' learning based on if numbers are divisible by either 3, 5 or both. 

Back-End: We completed an exercise on JavaScript back-end via a Color Cleaver & Color Combinator/Deconstructor, linking a backend JS page to a main JS page. It reminded me of how a CSS Style sheet or JS page is linked on an HTML page. I was told it wasn't an apples-to-apples comparison.

Switch: We learned about this method at the end of the week. It seems to be similar to if/ifelse statements/conditionals, but its main advantage is that it is more concise and a solution if you're bogged with many if/if else statements. 

Application: We started work on our second application at the end of the week which is will be entirely constructed on our own.  

   

**Thoughts**
1. Continued to write more 'comments' into the code to help me remember/learn what the specificing line means. 
2. Words of the Week: eschew, concatenate
3. Found the titles of the exercise pretty interesting. They reminded me of something from the musician R. Kelly's greatest hits album.
